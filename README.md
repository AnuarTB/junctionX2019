## Description
Smart AudioBook - The book that can read the text for you and even answer your questions based on the context of the book. Developed during JunctionX Seoul 2019!
## Development
This service was devoloped by using Flask framework. For speech recognition and speech synthesis we used Naver AI API [Clova Speech Recognition (CSR)](https://developers.naver.com/products/clova/vrecog/)and [Clova Speech Synthesis](https://www.ncloud.com/product/aiService/css) respectively. In addition to it we used very powerful open-source conversational AI library [DeepPavlov](https://deeppavlov.ai) for retrieving text semantics.
